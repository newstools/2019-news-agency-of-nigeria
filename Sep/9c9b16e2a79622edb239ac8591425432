The Federal High Court in Lagos on Tuesday ordered the immediate release of the convener of #RevolutionNow protest, Mr. Omoyele Sowore, from the custody of the Department of State Service, DSS.  Falana said that the DSS was illegal and not the creation of National Security Act. That it was SSS that was written in that section but the prosecution argued that it was the same but just a semantics. Falana referred the court to the case of MKO Abiola 1995 vs FG where the appellant was charged with treasonable felony and the court granted him bail even on self recognition. Falana said he was also charged with treasonable felony and Justice Taiwo Taiwo was the one who defended him and he was granted bail.
