Nigeria is set to host the 4th edition of the African International Conference on Islamic Finance (AICIF), a gathering of the leading financial experts, regulators and frontline voices from the global banking community. They will converge in Nigeria’s commercial capital, Lagos, to discuss how Africa can enhance its markets, build stronger, more robust economic ecosystems and ensure wider financial inclusion. This year’s conference is themed: Infrastructure Financing, Sustainability and the Future of African Markets and will hold on Monday, November 4 and Tuesday, November 5.
