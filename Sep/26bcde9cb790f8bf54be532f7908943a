He told The Zambian Sun that, Pastor Samanjomba took on many other yearly 90 days fasting programmes during which he only had a single meal in the evening each August. “I would say he died in the early hours, because my sister and his wife were there and took turns to check on him, and then it was time for my in law to check on him, she was with him according to her till mid night, “Then she decided to rest, when she woke up, they had a tendency of sharing dreams with each other as partners. So she dreamt of something and wanted to tell the husband. “But as she tried to shake him up, he was not responding and so he was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. “The only consolation that we have as a family is the way he died because he was in the closet with the Lord,” Reagan said.
