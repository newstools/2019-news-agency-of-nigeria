Hajiya Silifa Sule, the first lady of Nasarawa state, has tasked parents to promote the education of the girl child in the country. She made the call on Saturday during the visit of the state’s chapter of National Council of Women Societies (NCWS) to her in Gudi, Akwanga Local Government Area of the state. Sule said the significant role of an educated girl child to the society and the world must be fully harnessed. The state first lady said women as custodian of the home needed to be educated for the growth and development of their families and the society at large. She added that the development of any society was dependent on the quality of education given to children. Sule also advised parents to instill moral values as well as to ensure proper upbringing of their children so as to benefit from government programmes and policies. The governor’s wife appreciated the NCWS’s visit and assured them of her support to the societies to succeed. She said the present administration was committed to the education sector as well as women and youths empowerment in order to better their lives. The first lady further urged the women to be law abiding, respect constituted authorities, live in peace and to engage in meaningful ventures. Earlier, Mrs Aisha Isah-Idoma, the state President of the society, said that the visit was to congratulate the first lady on the successful inauguration of her husband. “NCWS is non–political, non religious but it is out to protect the interest of women and also to support women when they face any challenge. “And the only way to achieve success is for women to sustain the spirit of togetherness irrespective of their affiliation,” she said. She assured the first lady of the societies support to the present administration to enable it succeed.
