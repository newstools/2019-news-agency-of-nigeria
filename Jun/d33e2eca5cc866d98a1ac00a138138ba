 Catholic faithful in Lagos on Sunday joined others around the world to mark the Feast of the Pentecost with special prayers for the incoming ninth National Assembly. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Pentecost is the day the Holy Spirit descended on the Apostles and bestowed on them the wisdom to propagate the Gospel. Rev. FR. Jude Nwachukwu, Assistant Parish Priest, Saints Peter and Paul Tedi, Ojo, Lagos, reminded worshipers about the biblical injunction for people to pray for their leaders to remain on track. The Priest, in his Homely, said: “God through the choice of the people has assigned leaders to lead the country. “It behooves on us to make the best of the leaders by presenting them to God in prayers for the country to experience good governance. “The ninth Assembly has myriad of challenges staring at them as they begin sitting on Tuesday, especially on issues bordering on national security and the economy,’’ he said. According to him, Nigerians are expecting the incoming administration to better their lots; therefore the assembly members cannot afford to disappoint the people; hence they need prayers. Nwachukwu said that the church had received the gift of the Holy Ghost laden with wisdom; hence it is channeling same to the incoming assembly to lead the country to glory. NAN reports that the feast which was spiced up with songs from different groups marked the end of Easter season in the church calender. The feast usually comes up 50 days after Easter. (NAN)
