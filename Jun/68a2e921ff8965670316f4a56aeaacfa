His spokesperson,  Isa Gadau, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in a telephone interview that Gamawa died on Friday night in Bauchi,  after a brief illness. “He complained of slight stomach ache and was taken to the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital (ATBUTH), Bauchi, where he was admitted and later passed away. “I am now heading to his house,” Gadau said.
