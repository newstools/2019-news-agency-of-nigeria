The Bishop said the journalist, as the watchdog has the responsibility to create ideal atmosphere for progress and development of the human society through his skills and calling. He explained that communication was the basic human tool that helps Nigerians to connect to nations and fulfill those essential desires of man. “Communication, which is understood as a process of interaction by using messages to generate meaning, is basically an activity and exchange that is dynamic, ongoing, ever changing, and continuous. It has no end,” he said. He advised journalists and other Nigerians to make use of the internet judiciously and freely to build human community. Isizoh said that Nigerians should not use the social media to spread rumours that would caused disunity in the nation. He advised that everyone with a phone connected to the internet should be responsible for the internet security.
