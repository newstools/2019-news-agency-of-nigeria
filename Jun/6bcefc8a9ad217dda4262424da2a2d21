Its intervention in the agriculture sector includes services such as deployment of storage services, provision of electronic warehouse receipts, and the facilitation of input financing. Okafor said that there were many opportunities in a commodity value chain, which investors must be aware of to create wealth. She said that currently, only few investors in the commodity market understood the structure and operations of the market, hence the need to expand the scope. “With inclusion and innovation at the centre of today’s commodity markets, investors can find several routes to participate in the market,” Okafor said.
