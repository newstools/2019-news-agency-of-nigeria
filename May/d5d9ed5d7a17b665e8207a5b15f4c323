The ongoing purge against corruption and counterfeiting in Kenya has received a major boost as the European Union (EU) envoys declare their support on a crackdown. Kenya has since the inauguration of Uhuru Kenyatta as President declared war against ravaging corruption and faking of goods. The Ambassadors met the President in Nairobi ahead of the launch of a dialogue between the Kenya Private Sector Alliance and European Union Business Council. EU declared that corruption and related economic crimes were major hindrance to the growth of enterprises and expansion of the investment. The delegation of 18 envoys was led by the head of delegation of the European Union (EU) to Kenya Stephano Dejak. They expressed their support and encouraged President Kenyatta for the sweeping crackdown on corruption and related economic crimes including proliferation of counterfeit goods in the country. They pledged to increase funding for Kenyaâ€™s counter-terrorism activities, the Kenya Coast Guard service, value-chain addition in the blue economy and agribusiness programs. The EU committed to adding more funds to support of AMISOM and other peace keeping initiatives involving Kenya. The bloc committed to deepen its partnership with the government in the development of skilled labour through Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET). They said it is through technical and vocational training that the country can build adequate human resource capacity to enable the youth to engage in gainful employment. On the emerging blue economy sector, the envoys thanked the President for being the African champion and pledged to support Kenya to reap maximum benefits from its vast maritime resources. The envoys said they will pool their collective experience and utilize it to assist Kenya to accelerate momentum in the development of blue economy sectors such as fisheries and maritime transport for wealth and employment creation.
