By Ikenna Osuoha Chief Nwoha Amaechi, former Speaker, Imo State House of Assembly, says Emeka Nwajiuba’s cognate experience in legislation makes him credible to be the speaker of the House of Representatives. Amaechi made the assertion in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, while speaking on the need to support the South-East for the leadership of the lower legislative chambers of the National Assembly. He called on the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Nigerians to support the clamour for Igbo Speakership for a progressive and fair national leadership equation. The former speaker, who described the ruling party as a progressive political party, urged them to reflect their “progressive vision” by supporting Nwajiuba. “Emeka Nwajiuba is qualified to be the Speaker of the House of Representatives with intimidating records. “As a former member of the House of Representatives, he has cognate experience to pilot the affairs of the Green Chambers,” he said. Amaechi restated the imperatives of supporting Nwajiuba, noting that it would increase the popularity of APC in the South-East. He said that it was time for the APC-led Federal Government to demonstrate President Muhammadu Buhari’s belief in inclusive government by supporting Nwajiuba. The former lawmaker said that a Speaker of Igbo extraction was necessary for not only political fairness but natural justice considering the 25 per cent votes given to Buhari in the last election. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Buhari has promised to run an all-inclusive government in his second term.
