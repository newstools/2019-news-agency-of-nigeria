Manchester City have retained the English Premiership League (EPL) title they won last season after coming from a goal down to defeat Brighton & Hove Albion 4-1 and beating beating Liverpool to the prize in one of the most thrilling title races in years. Glenn Murray gave Brighton a surprise lead when he headed home Pascal Gross’s 27th minute corner, but Sergio Aguero levelled with a minute after played in by David Silva. Aymeric Laporte headed City in front from Riyad Mahrez’s corner in the 38 minutes to make it 2-1 at end of first half. Mahrez continued with his super display in the second half and finally found the back of the net to make it 3-1 before Ilkay Gundogan scored a brilliant free-kick to make it 4-1 to seal victory for City who beat Liverpool to the title with just one point. The battle for silverware went all the way down to the final day, with City entering their match against Brighton one point clear of Liverpool in second. The Reds hosted Wolves in their season finale and did what they had to do, beating Nuno’s side 2-0 at Anfield. However, City’s own victory kept them ahead of Liverpool, ensuring Pep Guardiola’s side claimed a second successive Premier League title.
