Mohammed Baba Busu Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe-Abdullahi, the Speaker of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, has called on stakeholders to support journalists across the country towards the realisation of improved welfare. Balarabe-Abdullahi made this call on Friday in a statement issued by his press secretary, Jibrin Gwamna in Lafia in commemoration of the World Press Freedom Day. The speaker, while underscoring the role of the media in nation building, called on all and sundry to give journalists the needed support and protection to succeed in their profession. “The men of the pen profession play a significant role in nation building, as we are all aware that when one is informed, he or she can travel beyond his or her local community. “Journalists are the mirror of the society and they are the voice of the voiceless, hence the need for all to give them the needed support to succeed, ” the statement said. According to Balarabe-Abdullahi, because of the essential role of journalists in the society, there is the need for their safety to be guaranteed. The Speaker advised journalists to always crosscheck their information before making it public in order not to send out wrong information that can cause chaos in the interest of peace and development. He bemoaned the growing trend of fake news and abuse of the social media by some Nigerians, and called for a change of attitude in that direction. Balarabe-Abdullahi pledged the continued commitment of the state House of Assembly under his leadership to support journalists for the overall development of the state.
