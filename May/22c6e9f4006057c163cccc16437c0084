Israel killed a Hamas commander in the Gaza Strip on Sunday in what the military described as a targeted strike and Palestinians said was the first such action since the 2014 war in the Palestinian enclave. A military statement said that Hamed Ahmed Abed Khudri had been responsible for transferring funds from Iran to armed factions in Gaza. Palestinian witnesses said he was killed in an air strike on his car. Earlier in March, an Israeli air strike targeted the office of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in the Gaza Strip on Monday, Hamas radio reported. Haniyeh was unlikely to have been in the office, as Hamas routinely evacuates its buildings when expecting Israeli attacks. An Israeli military spokesman declined to comment on the report.
