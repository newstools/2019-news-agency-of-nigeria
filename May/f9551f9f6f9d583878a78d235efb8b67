At event which held at the Indoor arena of the Sani Abacha Stadium, Kofar Mata, Ganduje explained: “The challenges of development are too many, are too weighty to be left in the hands of a highly centralized traditional institution.” Ganduje explained that the event was initiated by the four newly appointed traditional rulers to appreciate the government on their appointments. He said that the creation of the emirates, was well rooted in a strong foundation and that the law was irreversible. Adducing reasons for the creation of the emirates, he said that historically, Kano’s traditional rulers had been independent of one another. He noted that the government took the factor into consideration. Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero is the new emir of Bichi, one of the newly created emirates in Kano State.
