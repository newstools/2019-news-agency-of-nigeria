 The Duke of Sussex will today travel to the Netherlands just three days after the birth of his son Archie. Prince Harry is due to visit The Hague to launch the one-year countdown to the Invictus Games after he and Meghan Markle announced they had called their baby Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. In a photocall at St George’s Hall in Windsor Castle on Wednesday, Harry and Meghan presented the baby boy to the world for the first time. The new parents were later pictured showing off baby Archie to the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, alongside Ms Ragland, at Windsor Castle.
