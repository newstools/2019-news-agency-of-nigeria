The two candidates, Stevo Pendarovski of the ruling Social Democrats, and Gordana Siljanovska Davkova, backed by the conservative opposition VMRO-DPMNE party will slug it out in North Macedonia presidential election runoff. Both candidates finished in a near dead heat, with about 42% of the votes each in the first round of polls on April 21. More than 3,400 polling stations opened at 7 a.m. Sunday as the country vote in the presidential election runoff between the two top contenders. It remains to see if todayâ€™s turnout will reach the 40 per cent needed for the election to be valid, as the first round barely made it past, with a turnout of 41.8 per cent. If declared invalid, the two-round contest for the largely ceremonial post will be repeated.
