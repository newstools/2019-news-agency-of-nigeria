Seventeen ministers from Africa’s largest energy producing nations, including Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea and Tunisia, have agreed to meet in Cape Town, South Africa, at Africa Oil Week (AOW). The even is taking place from 4-8 November 2019 to broker new partnerships for their energy sectors. The ministers will be using Africa Oil Week Summit as a platform to discuss national strategies, sovereign competitiveness, issue licences and finalise tenders. With pressure growing on Sovereigns to develop attractive operating environments, the ministers will be detailing their hydrocarbon strategies to an audience of 1500+ senior executives from the entire upstream value chain, including NOCs and IOCs, Independent Operators, the Geoscience community, Service Companies and EPCs and the investment community. Dr Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Nigeria would attend. Nigeria is Africa’s largest oil producer and exporter; however it also has large gas reserves up for development, attracting interest from local operators such as Seplat and Oando who are sponsoring Africa Oil Week in 2019. Ministers from South Africa, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Djibouti, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Gambia, Mali, Zambia, Rwanda and Chad will also be speaking at the event.
