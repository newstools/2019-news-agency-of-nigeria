 Ukraine’s new president Volodymyr Zelensky has moved to disband parliament after being sworn in as the new president of Ukraine. The political novice is under pressure to deliver much-needed reforms after unseating Petro Poroshenko. Zelensky, a 41-year-old comic with no political experience, announced the dissolution of parliament in his inaugural speech as the president of Ukraine on Monday. Disbanding the chamber paves the way for the new head of state to call snap elections. The standup comedian needs support to tackle a raft of challenges, including a struggling economy and the conflict with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Source:
