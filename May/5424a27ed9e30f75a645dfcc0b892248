 Labour “doesn’t exist to stop Brexit”, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn said as he defended the party’s approach to the European elections. The party is seeking to appeal to both sides of the Brexit debate, insisting that the real divide in the country is between normal workers and the wealthy rather than Leavers and Remainers. Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon acknowledged it was a “difficult road” that the party had chosen “but it’s the right thing to do”. In comments which could cause further tensions within Labour between those calling for a second referendum and others who want to secure a soft Brexit deal, Mr Burgon insisted the party was not trying to prevent the UK’s exit from the European Union. “The Labour Party doesn’t exist to stop Brexit,” he told BBC Two’s Newsnight. “Other parties have been formed that think that is their only purpose politically.” The Liberal Democrats hope to poach pro-EU Labour voters with an uncompromising message of “bollocks to Brexit” for its European manifesto, with an alternative of Stop Brexit for voters with more refined sensibilities.
