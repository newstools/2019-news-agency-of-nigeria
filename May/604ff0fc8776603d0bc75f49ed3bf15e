The gospel choir catapulted into the spotlight after performing at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will pay their own musical tribute to the royal baby. The Kingdom Choir, who are currently on a UK tour following the success of their stint at the nuptial ceremony last May, have written a new lullaby especially for the Sussexes’ newborn son. They will perform it on Tuesday night when they will be at Bridgewater Hall in Manchester. Karen Gibson, choir leader, said: “On behalf of the whole of The Kingdom Choir, congratulations on the arrival of your little one and God Bless you all.” The group’s rousing performances of Stand By Me and Amen/This Little Light Of Mine during the wedding resulted in the ensemble signing a major record deal. The London-based choir was founded in 1994 by the group’s award-winning conductor Gibson. Source:
