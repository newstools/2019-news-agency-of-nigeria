A socio-political group in Akwa-Ibom state has warned all politicians in the state not to interfere with the election tribunal sitting in the state. The group, Akwa Ibom Liberation Movement in a statement on Friday, said it had reports that plans had been concluded for a media assault on the tribunal and on INEC. Leader of the group, Prince Emmanuel Sam, particularly alleged that some actors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state were the masterminds of the proposed media assault. Sam alleged that the plan was to plant fake news in both print and electronic media with the hopes of tarnishing the integrity of the tribunal and the election umpire. In the statement, Mr Sam said that his group had received intelligence that the opposition party has contracted different teams of citizen journalists to do the hatchet job. “The respective teams are working for different candidates of the party. Their mandate is to create and circulate stories to discredit INEC and the PDP, and plant indicting reports against the tribunal as though they are sponsored by the PDP.” “Our Intel shows that many candidates of the APC who are at the tribunal have set up propangada teams specifically for the tribunal. “Their job is to flood the public space with lopsided reports on the proceedings of the tribunal, with the aim to stir fear in the people and distort public opinion about the tribunal. The group called on all parties to accept their victories of defeat, urging those who lost to join hands with the winners to move the state forward. The release states that any Akwa Ibom person who is seeking public office and yet uses his wealth to hire people to cause fear, disharmony and disunity in the State did not have the interest of the people at heart in the first place. The group therefore urged the public to disregard or be dicreet with any information that will tarnish the image of the tribunal.
