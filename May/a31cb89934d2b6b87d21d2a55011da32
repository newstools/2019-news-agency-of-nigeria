By Gabriel Yough Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba has expressed great sadness over renewed violent clashes between Tiv and Jukun and passionately appeal for peace. Ishaku on Saturday urged the warring factions in Wukari Local Government Area (LGA) of the state to sheathe their sword and give peace a chance. Mr Bala Dan Abu, his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the governor said in a statement released in Jalingo on Saturday. “Governor Ishaku is greatly saddened by the news of the unfortunate renewed violent clashes between Jukun and their Tiv neighbours in Kente and Rafinkada which occurred on Friday. “This latest crisis, like the ones before, resulted in the loss of innocent lives and the destruction of valuable properties. “The Jukun and the Tiv living in the border communities have every reason to live together in peace, they are both farmers struggling to earn living mainly from the produce from their farms,” he said. Ishaku, he said, had since directed security agencies to move to the scenes in Kente and Rafinkada to curb the crisis and restore order. He said the governor was appealing to leaders of the communities to play their part by prevailing on their people to drop their weapons and to cooperate with the security agencies to ensure that peace is sustained among them. The governor also condemned the ongoing attacks and killings of innocent people in some farming communities in Ardo Kola and Jalingo Local governments and the reprisal attacks thereafter. He warned that security agencies have been instructed by the governor to deal ruthlessly with those promoting the crises and killings in the state. (NAN)
