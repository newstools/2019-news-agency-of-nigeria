 The widespread leakage of questions has forced Somali to cancel the ongoing secondary school exit examination. The country has re-scheduled the examination for end of May. Social media would also be shut for the five days of the examination. Somalia had cancelled national secondary school examinations after papers were leaked via social media and sold. Students have been sitting their final year of school exams since Saturday but the leakage of papers at one examination centre forced Education Minister Abdullahi Godah Barre to go on national television on Monday night to announce the cancellation of the exams. The exams will now be retaken from May 27 to 31. Social media will be shut during the five days to curb the illegal circulation of papers, the minister added.
