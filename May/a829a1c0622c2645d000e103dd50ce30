 President Joko Widodo on Wednesday said he  will not tolerate anyone disrupting security, the democratic process and the unity of Indonesia. He made this known following rioting in Jakarta, the capital, after official election results were announced. “We will not give any space for rioters who try to damage our country, the state of unity of the Republic of Indonesia,” Widodo told reporters. “There is no choice, the military and police will take firm action in accordance with the law.” Demonstrations over the outcome of last month’s presidential election gripped central Jakarta after an overnight face-off between police and protesters in which, the city’s governor said, six people were killed.
