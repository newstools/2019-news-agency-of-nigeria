Oil prices fell on Thursday, pulled down by record U.S. crude production that led to a surge in stockpiles. Outside the United States, however, oil markets remained tense as exemptions to U.S. sanctions on Iran expired, a political crisis in Venezuela escalates, and as producer club OPEC keeps withholding supply. Spot Brent crude oil futures were at $71.91 per barrel at 0239 GMT, 27 cents, or 0.4 percent, below their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 19 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $63.41 per barrel. “Crude oil prices fell sharply as stockpiles in the U.S. rose to their highest level since 2017,” ANZ bank said on Thursday. “This comes as U.S. refineries head into the spring maintenance period, stoking fears that crude oil demand will be soft and stockpiles will continue to rise,” it added. U.S. crude stockpiles last week rose to their highest since September 2017, jumping by 9.9 million barrels to 470.6 barrels, as production set a record high of 12.3 million barrels per day (bpd), while refining activity rates fell, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday.

Oman’s energy minister Mohammed bin Hamad al-Rumhy said on Wednesday it was OPEC’s goal to extend the cuts, which were started in January, when they next meet in June. Despite the desire of many OPEC members to keep withholding supply to prop up the market, the group may be forced into action. “The Venezuelan situation will likely loom large in OPEC deliberations as ministers weigh how many additional barrels may be needed to fill an expanding supply gap that is being driven by geopolitics as opposed to geology,” Canadian bank RBC Capital Markets said. Beyond Venezuela, analysts at Fitch Solutions also warned of risks to supply from Libya, where a civil war is threatening to cut oil fields off from markets. The risks here are not inconsiderable, in light of rising instability in a number of key producers, notably Libya and Venezuela,” Fitch Solutions said. More on Reuters
