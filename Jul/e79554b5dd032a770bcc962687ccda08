The unusual incident came amid tensions between Israel and Hamas movement which runs Gaza, the coastal enclave. Israel and Hamas have reportedly reached initial understandings as part of Egypt’s efforts to broker a long term cease fire between the two. Both sides accuse each other of violating the understandings, with Israel occasionally imposing and lifting restrictions on the permitted fishing zone and fuel supply to Gaza and Gazans.
