Tunisia ended Madagascar’s remarkable Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) run when they beat the rank outsiders 3-0 in their quarter-final on Thursday. Interestingly, Tunisia notched their first win of the tournament in the process. Madagascar, a country with little football tradition and who had not been expected to progress beyond the group stage on their first appearance at the finals, held out until the second half. They were first undone by Ferjani Sassi’s deflected shot. Youssef Msakni added a second on the hour for the Carthage Eagles, ranked 25th in the world against Madagascar’s 107th. And substitute Naim Sliti finished it off on the break in stoppage time to earn them a semi-final against Senegal on Sunday. Tunisia had drawn their previous four matches at the tournament, beating Ghana on penalties in the last 16.
