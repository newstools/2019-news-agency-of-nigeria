By Ikenna Osuoha National Population Commission (NPopC) on Tuesday reiterated its readiness
to conduct reliable and accurate census for the country whenever Federal Government authorised
it to do so. The Director General of the commission, Dr Ghajji Bello, made this known in an interview with News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. He said that although government had not fixed time for head count in the country, it was long overdue. Bello explained that the commission would deliver on its mandate of aggregating the exact number of Nigerian citizens when
called upon. He said “we are waiting to be authorised and funded by Federal Government. The director general, who assured the commission’s preparedness to give the nation adequate coverage in the
census, said every nook and cranny of the country would be captured. He said “NPopC will not over count or under count anybody but will give accurate and reliable census.” Bello appealed for support and called on Federal Government to give census accelerated attention, saying
it was time to have accurate update on Nigeria’s current population with a reliable figure. Nigeria, said to have a population of about 198 million people, conducted the last head count in 2006. (NAN)
