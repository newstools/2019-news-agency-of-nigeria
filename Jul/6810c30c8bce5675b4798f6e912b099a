 Boeing is warning that it might have to halt production of the 737 Max if grounding continues much longer. The company reported its largest-ever quarterly loss of  three billion dollars  on Wednesday because of the troubled aeroplane. If hurdles with regulators worldwide continue, Boeing said it would consider reducing or shutting down production of the 737 Max entirely. However, Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg is confident the plane will be back in the air by October. Source:
