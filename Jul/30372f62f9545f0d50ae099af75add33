……….those engaged in 2010 electoral violence on list By Harrison Arubu The U.S. Government has imposed visa restrictions on “individuals responsible for undermining the Nigerian democratic process”. A spokesperson of the U.S. Department of State, Ms Morgan Ortagus, who announced this in a statement on Tuesday, said the action applied to those responsible for election-related violence.
