A former President, National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Dr. Yakubu Shendam has donated 700 inheritance plots of land to the proposed farm settlement initiative of the Cross River State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade in Boki local government area. A statement issued in Ikom on Wednesday by Shendam, the House of Representatives candidate of New Generation party (NGP) for Boki/Ikom Federal Constituency in the 2019 elections said the gesture was in support of prosperity of the area. According to Shendam who is a native of Njua kaku village in Boki local government area, the governor’s programme on agriculture will boost development and create opportunities for economic prosperity for youths in the state. “Agriculture is the bedrock of any nation’s survival and if Ayade is thinking in this direction, we should be celebrating. For me and my people, we are 100 percent in support of this laudable initiative. “This is why I am donating my own inheritance land which is about 700 plots from what the Surveyors measured as a token to support the proposed farm settlement initiatives of the Governor. “We must embrace development without attaching political sentiments to causes that are in the interest of our area and state in general. “Sir Michael Opara, once did this kind of programme during the regional administration days and today, we are still benefiting from those farm settlements many of which can still be seen in our area. “Examples are the Borum palms estate, NSADOP, Onicha Boje and others in Boki LGA. As a Prince, I encourage the community to embrace this gesture coming to our land,” he added. Shendam who is a native of Njua Kaku village in Boki LGA is a third son of His Royal Highness, Asu Osang Marculey, the village head of Njua Kaku ancient community.
