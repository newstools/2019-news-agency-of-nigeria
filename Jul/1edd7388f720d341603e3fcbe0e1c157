 Facebook must conduct a review of its privacy policies of any product, service or practice, new or changed, before being implemented and document all its decisions in this regard, the statement said. In addition, WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, which are part of the conglomerate of the aforementioned company, must comply with the proposed rules. Press reports recalled that the trigger that led to this fine was the information released in March 2018 that the British consultancy Cambridge Analytica used an application to collect data from 87 million Facebook users without their consent and for political purposes.
