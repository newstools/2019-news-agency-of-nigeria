He added that the National Association of Nigerian students (NANS) had complained about substandard infrastructure in many institutions across the country.  Bogoro told the quantity surveyors that TETFUND would not tolerate poorly executed jobs, and urged the surveyors to play their roles as professionals. “Help us talk to your professional colleagues that they should be patriotic, and demonstrate that they are professionals whenever given any infrastructure to handle. “Lets have quality projects for we can’t continue to just have numbers,’’ Bogoro said. He said that he had discussed with his board of trustees about focusing on “quality infrastructure rather than just numbers.’’ Mr Otaru Omokhagbo, Chairman of the FCT chapter of the NIQS, said the visit was part of their mandate to interact with organisations that employ over 10 quantity surveyors.
