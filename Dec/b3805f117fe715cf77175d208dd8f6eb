Ajiboye stated that 47Computer-Based Test Centres would be used for the teachers’ exams. He said that Lagos State had the highest number of candidates with 8,223 followed by Oyo State which had 5,599, while Sokoto State had the least with 360 candidates. The TRCN Registrar disclosed that Commissioners of Education would be on the field to monitor the examinations and would be supported by technical staff from the council. The TRCN Registrar stated that private schools had the largest number of candidates. “The private schools register more candidates to show that the teachers of the private schools are responding more,” he said. Ajiboye added that the council recorded 80 percent pass in the October 2019 PQ Examinations. He identified technology as a major challenge confronting teachers at the early stage of the PQE, adding that performance had improved with the computer appreciation support from the Nigerian Union of Teachers to its members.
