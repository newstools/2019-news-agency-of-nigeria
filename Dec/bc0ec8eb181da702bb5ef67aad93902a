 A popular tourist-destination volcano erupted in New Zealand on Monday, leaving up to 20 people injured and others missing. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said roughly 100 tourists were on or near White Island — which is 30 miles from mainland New Zealand — during the “very significant” eruption at about 2:15 p.m. local time. “Some of those, at this stage, are unaccounted for. A number of people are reportedly injured and are being transported to shore,” she said. The prime minister said there were no confirmed deaths. St John, a New Zealand emergency response group assisting in the rescue, said up to 20 people were injured. White Island is New Zealand’s most active volcano, according to GeoNet, and scientists reportedly noted a recent uptick in volcanic activity on the island.  Source:
