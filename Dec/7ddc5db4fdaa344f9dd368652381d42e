Boeing will temporarily halt production of its troubled 737 Max airliner in January, the manufacturer said. Production of the jet had continued despite the model being grounded for nine months after two deadly crashes. More than 300 people died when two 737 Max aircraft crashed in Indonesia and Ethiopia after reported problems with a new feature. Boeing had been hoping to have the aircraft back in the air by the end of this year. But US regulators made it clear that the planes would not be certified to return to the skies that quickly. Boeing is one of the largest US exporters.
