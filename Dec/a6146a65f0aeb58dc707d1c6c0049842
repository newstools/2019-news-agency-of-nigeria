As before, a distant thunderous roar approached before a single jolt struck, giving me an instant headache and making my hairs stand on end! (05.11.19, approx 22.45) — TWITCHCRAFT!

The US Geological Survey said the quake hit at a depth of 10 kilometres and measured as a 3.4 on the Richter scale. The United Kingdom occasionally has small tremors. The most recent “significant” quake was a 4.6 magnitude felt in Cwmllynfell in South Wales. The strongest in the last 20 years was a 5.2 in Lincolnshire. Source:
