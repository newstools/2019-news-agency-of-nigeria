Justin Bieber has been on the hunt for a new house in Los Angeles with wife Hailey and it appears that the planned new residence isn’t the only change the 10,000 Hours artist is embracing. He stepped out Sunday afternoon, revealing a fresh ‘do with a head of cotton candy pink hair. The 25-year-old hid the look for a moment under a green hoodie as he enjoyed a game of hoops outside his Beverly Hills home. Bieber appeared to be taking it easy while his ex Selena Gomez and nemesis Taylor Swift were performing at the American Music Awards. He eventually pulled his hood back to reveal the colorful new hairstyle while dribbling the ball. The Canadian popstar took off his hoodie as he wrapped up the game and headed inside with a friend. Underneath, he wore an oversized white t-shirt, paired with some hot pink sweatpants, matching his new ‘do. Justin and Hailey were recently spotted looking at a mansion for sale on Mulholland Drive in the Hollywood Hills. He recently put his Beverly Hills mansion on the market, posting the listing to Instagram. To sweeten the deal, he also offered potential buyers: ”I’ll sell it with all the furniture. Make an offer.’ Justin and Hailey’s house previously went on the market in November 2018 for almost 9million dollars before they scooped it up in March 2019 for 8.5million dollars.
