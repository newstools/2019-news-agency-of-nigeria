 At least 16 passengers and two crew are believed to have died after a plane crashed into houses in Goma city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The aircraft crashed in the Mapendo neighbourhood after “missing” its take-off from the city’s international airport, North Kivu regional governor Nzanzu Kasivita said. He said there had been deaths, but did not give a number. Residents on the ground were among the casualties, local media reported.
