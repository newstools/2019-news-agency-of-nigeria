By Ginika Okoye The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), has emerged the third-best performing agency of the Federal Government in the ease of doing business assessment of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). A statement issued in Abuja on Thursday by the management of the commission, said the assessment period was between June 2017 and May 2019. The commission noted that the assessment was contained in the 2019 Compliance Report on Executive Order (EO1) released recently by the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC). It said the key indicators for the assessment were transparency and efficiency. It quoted Mr Babatunde Irukera, the Chief Executive Officer of the commission as saying “the assessment was encouraging, humbling and challenging as it recognised the positive treatment of consumers. “This is a testament to what is possible when all work together to focus on and prioritise what is really most important and the greatest asset of this country, its people. “I call on staff of the commission to strive not only to be the best performing nationally, but to be internationally regarded,’’ he said. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that PEBEC was set up in July 2016 by President Muhammadu Buhari, to remove bureaucratic constraints in doing business in the country. The council is an inter-governmental and inter-ministerial one, chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Other members include 10 ministers, Head of Service of the Federation, Governor of CBN, representatives of Lagos and Kano State government, the National Assembly and the private sector. (NAN)
