…..Can fund nation’s budget for FCT, Defence, Education, Health, 6 other ministries ……Proposal 34% higher than 2019’s Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Friday presented a budget of N1.168 trillion to the Lagos State House of Assembly for approval for the 2020 fiscal year. The proposal represent 11.3 per cent of the proposed 2020 budget of the entire country which is put at 10.22 trillion. The proposed budget is to be funded by a projected Total Revenue of N1.071 trillion and a deficit amounting to N97.53 billion. The budget size is higher than the 2019 budget by 34%. Capital Expenditure amounts to N723.75 billion while the Recurrent Expenditure is N444.81 billion, giving a 62:38 capital to recurrent ratio. According to the figures, the proposed Lagos Budget can fund the Federal Government’s proposal for nine core ministries including Works, Education Health and also the FCT. The 1.168 trillion can cater for the Nation’s Ministry of Works with N262bn proposal, Transport ministry with N123 billion, Universal Basic Education N112 billion with Education Ministry at N48 billion. The Budget can also fund Nigeria’s ministry of Defense with proposal put at N100 billion, Agriculture at N82 billion, Water at 82 billion, Niger Delta at 81 billion, Health at 46 billion and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) at N28 billion. According to Sanwo-Olu, “This, in our view, is strong for development. We have placed an increased focus on wealth creation where we will take deliberate steps in courting a partnership between our people and various development institutions. “In line with this, we have provided N11.8bn as counterpart funds in preparation for various social impact schemes. In addition, we have made provisions for N7.1bn this year, to provide for industrial hubs, parks, graduate internship programs and virtual markets for artisans. This is in support for Micro, Small and Medium enterprises which are the engines for both economic and employment growth. “It is equally proposed that a total of N167.81 billion of the Recurrent Expenditure shall be applied towards personnel costs and other staff-related expenses. This represents 22.02% of the proposed Total Revenue, which is within the acceptable wage policy of 25% of Total Revenue, and includes a provision for the new minimum wage. “The budget deficit of N97.53 billion will be financed by both internal and external loans. Since revenue generation is the spine of any budget, this budget supports investment in our revenue generating agencies. This budget seeks to aggressively invest in and develop our education, health and other physical infrastructure sectors. Although our capital spent on works and infrastructure was just N31 billion as at September 2019, as against the 2019 budget
proposal of N78 billion, it is our intention to spend N115 billion in 2020,” he said. The governor said Education would see a significantly increased capital budgetary allocation of N48 billion, an increase of 60% over the 2019 provision of N30 billion, adding that “we must improve the standard and relevance of our education outcomes to our industries. We will work together with our Local governments to strengthen early child education and teachers training/administration, leveraging technology. “Similarly, in healthcare, we have provided for a capital expenditure of N33 billion, compared to the 2019 budget proposal of N21 billion. We will ensure that our primary health care institutions remain active and attractive to the
primary health care needs of our people. Lagos belongs to us all; we will continue therefore to drive partnerships with the private sector in promoting health services within our institutions. “Given the perennial challenges of flooding in the metropolis, we have tripled the capital budget provision to tackle this from N3 billion in 2019 to N9 billion in 2020,” he added. Sanwo-Olu stated that wider consultation was made in the three senatorial districts, in addition to taking memoranda and feedback from stakeholders’ meetings organized by members of the House within their constituencies, which were also attended by Cabinet members, adding that the 2020 Budget would be supported by a Performance Management System that would ensure that, by December 2020,” we shall achieve an optimal budget implementation when compared with previous years. This is in line with our commitment to transparency and accountability in the management of public finances.” Culled
