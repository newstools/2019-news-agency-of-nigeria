Mr Peter Ekwueme, President of the association, gave the commendation at a news conference in Abuja on Wednesday. Ekwueme, who described the initiative as unprecedented, said it was key to engendering youth empowerment and wealth creation. He urged the state government to ensure free and fair process of selecting beneficiaries.
