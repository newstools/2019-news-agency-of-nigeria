Ship
After three months of surveying in disputed parts of the South China Sea, a Chinese vessel left the area on Thursday and returned to Chinese waters, marine data shows. According to Marine Traffic, a website that tracks ships’ movements, the Haiyang Dizhi 8, a seismic survey vessel, left Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and headed back towards China, accompanied by two other Chinese ships. It remains unclear whether the ship is leaving the area or merely returning for fuel. The vessel has already returned once since it arrived in the area in early July. The survey ship first entered Vietnam’s EEZ on July 3, in the southern area of the East Vietnam Sea near the Spratly Islands, sparking a stand-off between Vietnamese and Chinese coastguard forces. The ship left the area again on August 7, according to the Vietnamese government and publicly available maritime data, before returning a week later. China claims almost all of the region and has been involved in territorial disputes with several countries across South-East Asia. Oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea is a highly fraught issue in both China and Vietnam, which had a series of violent disputes between 1974 and 1988 over control of the Spratly and Paracel Islands.
