 Oil major Total will not risk going alone in producing battery cells for electric vehicles, said Totalâ€™s Chairman and Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne on Thursday. He also said the group was in talks with other companies on a battery consortium, adding that this would need subsidies. France and Germany in April initiated a first European battery cell consortium, including carmaker PSA with its German subsidiary Opel, and French battery maker Saft, a unit of Total. (Reuters/NAN)
