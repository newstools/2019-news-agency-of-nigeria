By Emmanuel Afonne Sen. Dino Melaye has assured his supporters that he will continue to defeat his political rival Sen. Smart Adeyemi, in any senatorial election organised in Kogi West. Melaye was reacting to Appeal’s Court judgement that upheld the Election Tribunal’s ruling which annulled his election as the senator representing Kogi West. The Appeal Court had on Friday ordered that a fresh election be conducted but Melaye insisted that the fresh election would still go in his favour having beaten Adeyemi in two previous elections. The results of February election declared by INEC showed that Melaye, who contested on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) scored 85,395 votes to defeat Smart Adeyemi of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who polled 66,901 votes. Apparently displeased with the outcome of the election, Adeyemi approached the tribunal which in turn ruled in his favour in August. A three-man panel led by Justice A. O. Chijioke in a unanimous judgment accepted Adeyemi’s argument and ordered for fresh election into the Kogi West senatorial district. Displeased with the judgment of Justice Chijioke’s led tribunal, Senator Melaye approached the Appeal Court to appeal the ruling. However, on Friday, Oct. 11, the Appeal Court upheld the judgment of the tribunal and ordered a fresh election within 90 days. Melaye who posted a video on his Facebook page titled “I will defeat my political wife Smart Adeyemi again”, said the fresh election would be the third goal he would score against his opponent.
