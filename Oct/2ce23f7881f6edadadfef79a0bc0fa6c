The 39 suspected migrants found dead in a trailer shipped from Belgium to Britain are all Chinese nationals, reports on Thursday said. Broadcasters BBC, ITV and Sky News all reported the nationality of the victims as Chinese, citing unidentified sources. British police said earlier that they were still trying to establish the identities of the suspected migrants, who were discovered inside a trailer at an industrial estate near London. Belgian prosecutors confirmed that the container was shipped from the port of Zeebrugge on Tuesday. Essex Police have questioned a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland, who was arrested on suspicion of murder after the 39 bodies were found early Wednesday. Police Service Northern Ireland searched two properties in the Northern Irish village of Laurelvale, County Armagh late Wednesday, where the driver and his family lived, the Belfast Telegraph reported. British police found the bodies of 38 adults and one teenager in a lorry container on an industrial site in Grays, about 20 miles (32 km) east of central London in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Police arrested the driver, a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland, on suspicion of murder, and he was held in custody. Police said the trailer had arrived at docks in Essex, southern England, having traveled from Zeebrugge in Belgium and the bodies were found just over an hour later at 1.40 am. The red cab unit of the truck was believed to have originated in Ireland. It had “Ireland” emblazoned on the windscreen along with the message “The Ultimate Dream”. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was appalled by the news and was receiving regular updates about the investigation which was focused on human trafficking. The National Crime Agency said it was assisting the investigation and working to “urgently identify and take action against any organized crime groups who have played a role in causing these deaths.”
