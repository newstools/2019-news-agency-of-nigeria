By Olanrewaju Akojede Nigeria’s leading automotive trading platform, Cars45 on Monday announced the launch of its new product — Premium Inspection Service — in line with its avowed commitment to exploring new platforms that create convenience for end-users. The Media Consultant, Cars45, Bemigho Awala, said the valued-added service would allow Cars45 to cater for individuals who were unable to visit any of its inspection centers but would still like to use its service to sell their cars. “To enjoy the premium inspection service, customers will be required to make an upfront payment of N10,000 to book an appointment. “Cars45 in turn will visit the seller’s preferred location to inspect, provide a valuation report and purchase the car,” he said.
