General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has announced the kidnap of five pastors of the church. Adeboye disclosed this on Friday during a talk at the Redeemed Camp along Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The pastors were on their way to attend the church’s ministers’ conference in Lagos. Adeboye said the abduction took place on Thursday along the Ijebu-Ode axis. He charged the congregation to pray for the release of the abductees, saying it was the first time such incident was happening. “As a father, how do you think I should feel to hear that five of my children have been kidnapped while on their way to attend the Ministers Conference?” he asked.
