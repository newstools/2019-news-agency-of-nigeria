By Emmanuel Afonne The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC has denied raiding the residence of the immediate past Governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode, in spite a trending video signifying their presence at his house. The EFCC, in a statement on its Instagram page on Tuesday said it had been inundated with calls that operatives of the Commission raided the residence of the former governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode. “We need to state for the records that the EFCC did not raid Ambode’s house. It is instructive that his administration, like other former governors is under investigation, since they no longer constitutionally enjoy immunity against prosecution. “The Commission hereby states with high sense of responsibility that the operatives did not raid Ambode’s residence. “Whatever the Commission is presently doing with regards to the investigation is in line with its mandate and the rule of law. “We wish to inform the social media to be circumspect in the reportage of any news with regards to investigation activities of the Commission,” the statement said. “Our operations are always covert until at a time when we file charges in court. “Therefore, the attempt to cast the Commission in a bad light is unacceptable as the EFCC will never engage in illegal act. We remain committed to the war against corruption.” See EFCC Instagram post below:   We Did Not Raid Ex-Gov. Ambode’s Residence-EFCC . .
