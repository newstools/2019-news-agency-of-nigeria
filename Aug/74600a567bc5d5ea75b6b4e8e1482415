Delta Governor, Senator (Dr) Ifeanyi Okowa, has urged the Federal Government to take strident measures to curb protracting clashes between herdsmen and farmers in the country. The governor made the call on Saturday at the 21st Ogwa Ika and 17th Ika Ka Mma Annual Lecture Series organised by Onu Ika Nigeria at Abavo, Ika South Local Government Area of the state. He disclosed that his administration was doing its best to check the excesses of Fulani herdsmen, but regretted however that his efforts had been restrained by his limited control of security apparatus. He decried the frequent loss of lives from attacks by suspected herdsmen on defenseless farmers and other Nigerians, insisting that the government must make efforts to curb the menace. On irregular migration of youths seeking greener pastures in foreign countries and increasing child-trafficking, he charged parents and caregivers to live up to their responsibility by openly condemning the act and restrain their children from embarking on such dangerous journeys. Okowa condemned the situation where parents mounted undue pressure on their children and wards to embark on journeys to Europe through the desert, saying that the lives of many promising Nigerians had been lost in the process. He commended Onu Ika for organising annual essay competition for secondary schools in Ikaland, and urged the people to encourage government to carry out development projects through the donation of land. Earlier, the Head, Collective Leadership, Onu Ika Nigeria, Mr Daniel Usifor, said in an address that “for three years, Onu Ika has noticed a disturbing influx of the new set of deadly Fulani herdsmen in our communities. He urged the government to take actions to check the menace of the herdsmen and thanked the governor for his administration’s commitment to the development of the state.
